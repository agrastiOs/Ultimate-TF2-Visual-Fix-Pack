### What *is* UVF?

It is a pack of visual fixes and improvements for TF2, to be sent to Valve, both whole and a-la-carte. Not intended to be a subjective "overhaul" texture pack, but is intended to cohesively fix visual issues and revert visual downgrades, and do a consistency pass through all the changes and additions that were made on the long history of the game. Fixes are made in-house or by the original item creator, which is also looked into pretty deeply and compared with the art style of the game if sometimes questions arise, sometimes also referring to the consensus of the community. 

"Subjective" visual improvements and drastic changes are avoided. The full pack makes the game look a bit more modern, yet a bit more akin to its original intentions, before many updates (usually unintentionally) negatively impacted various visual aspects of TF2. Most of the visual downgrades had happened unintentionally, thus most did not improve performance, in fact it is often the opposite case.

Contains models, materials, textures, particles, and source files that can be easily modified and compiled.

### Highlights of the pack:

* A consistency pass for both stock and non-stock: the few weapons that had the ugly (particularly in darker environments or places with bright cube maps) environmental cube map applied have been fixed, and glass for all weapons is now more or less consistent.
* Explosions have been improved, they look slightly better and have less annoying smoke with a shorter lifetime and more transparency. A new Rocket/Sticky Jumper explosion has also been made that fits the Jumper theme.
* Fixed Dragon Fury itself looking bland, and Thermal Thruster has a better texture now (and synced up particles with the thruster bursts!).
* Fixed Dragon's Fury not to be as laggy and blinding, also particle size now correctly is like the hitbox size and visually improved.
* Fixed killstreak sheens to work on weapons like the Prinny Machete and the Crossing Guard.
* Fixed Photo Badge and Clan Pride to have the default texture the creators intended to be used. Valve said they would fix it 5 years ago, but it never happened.
* Fixed Pyro flames being blinding and ugly (now in Pre-JI style), and them just breaking completely sometimes. Crit flames have also been improved so the vapor is no longer completely separate from the flames.
* Fixed many weapons missing glows when critical hit boosted.
* Fixed some cosmetics that sometimes become completely neon-colored (Being completely glowing white/yellow/blue).
* General cosmetic fixes like fixing bad .vmt parameters and bad/wrong team texture colors. (e.g., several Ellis' Cap reskin cosmetics that had bad materials now look much better, Pocket Medic's Heavy version no longer looks bland and a Spy disguised as a Heavy equipping the cosmetic can fully cloak now, Tyurtlenek's blue texture now matches with Heavy's shirt, Lucky Shot now looks consistent with Soldier's actual helmet, Antarctic Eyewear's white goggles problem (fixed by item's creator) and such and similar fixes are included.)
* The Heavy's miniguns have 3D-looking shells now, not the orange squares.
* Many non-stock weapons also got improved to be closer to the old stock weapon style and are more consistent.
* Many stock weapons got the good/proper shading parameters which were messed up mainly in the Gun Mettle (a few other updates also degraded viewmodel quality) update.
* Muzzleflashes have been improved, for example, Minigun's is similar to the pre-Mecha Update one and the pistol/revolver's flashes no longer lag and are more solid/locked.
* Sentry Buster not being visibly Jarate'd and Ubered has been fixed, and the Engineer and Heavy bots' heads aren't glowing anymore, additionally, the Engineer was given team-colored glowing eyes.
* Several weapons that were missing proper lighting parameters entirely/used incorrect parameters for cosmetics received proper parameters.
* Some weapons with incorrect light warps received the good-looking and correct "weapon" light warp.
* Some weapons with missing LODs and bad smoothing have been fixed.
* Wearable weapons received some fixes too, including the Gunboats looking like intended, and all wearable weapons received a consistent light warp for visibility and consistency purposes.
* Other miscellaneous fixes (Panzer Pants tank material fix, Self-Made particles fix for them scattering too wide, etc.).
