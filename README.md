### What *is* UVF?

It is a pack of visual fixes for TF2, to be sent to Valve. Not intended to be a subjective "overhaul" texture pack, but is intended to fix visual issues and revert not performance-related visual downgrades. Fixes are made in-house or by the original item creator, which are also looked into pretty deeply and compared with the art style of the game if sometimes questions arise. "Subjective" visual improvements are avoided, and nothing too drastic because this, as mentioned before, will be presented to Valve, both as it whole and a-la-carte.

Contains models, materials, textures, particles, and source files that can be easily modified and compiled.

### Highlights of the pack:

* A consistency pass for both stock and non-stock: the few weapons which had the ugly (particularly in darker environments or places with bright cubemap) environmental cube map applied have been fixed, glass for all weapons is now more or less consistent.
* Explosions have been improved, they look slightly better and have less annoying smoke with a shorter lifetime and more transparency. Additionally, a new Rocket/Sticky Jumper explosion has been made that fits the Jumper theme.
* Fixed Dragon Fury itself looking bland, and Thermal Thruster has a better texture now (and synced up particles with the thrusters bursts!).
* Fixed Dragon's Fury to not be as laggy and blinding, also particle size now correctly is like the hitbox size and visually improved.
* Fixed killstreak sheens to work on weapons like the Prinny Machete and the Crossing Guard.
* Fixed Photo Badge and Clan Pride to have the default texture the creators intended to be used. Valve said they will fix it 5 years ago, but it never happened.
* Fixed Pyro flames being blinding and ugly (now in Pre-JI style), and them just breaking completely sometimes. Crit flames have also been improved so the vapor is no more completely separate from the flames.
* Fixed many weapons missing glows when critical hit boosted.
* Fixed some cosmetics sometimes becoming completely neon-colored (Being completely glowing white/yellow/blue).
* General cosmetic fixes like fixing bad .vmt parameters and bad/wrong team texture colors. (e.g., several Ellis' Cap reskin cosmetics that had bad materials now look much better, Pocket Medic's Heavy version no longer looks bland and a Spy disguised as a Heavy equipping the cosmetic can fully cloak now, Tyurtlenek's blue texture now matches with Heavy's shirt, Lucky Shot now looks consistent with Soldier's actual helmet, Antarctic Eyewear's white goggles problem (fixed by item's creator) and such and similar fixes are included.)
* Heavy's miniguns have 3D looking shells now, not the orange squares.
* Many non-stock weapons also got improved to be closer to the old stock weapon style and are more consistent.
* Many stock weapons got the good/proper shading parameters which were messed up mainly in the Gun Mettle (a few other updates also degraded viewmodel quality) update.
* Muzzleflashes have been improved, for example, Minigun's is similar to the pre-Mecha Update one and the pistol/revolver's flashes no longer lag and are more solid/locked.
* Sentry Buster not being visibly Jarate'd and Ubered has been fixed, the Engineer and Heavy bots' heads aren't glowing anymore, additionally, the Engineer was given team-colored glowing eyes.
* Several weapons that were missing proper lighting parameters entirely/used incorrect parameters for cosmetics received proper parameters.
* Some weapons with incorrect lightwarps received the good looking and correct "weapon" lightwarp.
* Some weapons with missing LODs and bad smoothing have been fixed.
* Wearable weapons received some fixes too, including the Gunboats looking like intended, and all wearable weapons received a consistent lightwarp for visibility and consistency purposes.
* Other miscellaneous fixes (Panzer Pants tank material fix, Self-Made particles fix for them scattering too wide, etc.).
